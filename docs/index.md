> :musical_score: Semantic music notation

## About

`bach` is an open-source music notation that people and computers can easily read or write. It is entirely text-based and can be written in any text editor.

`bach` is different from other music notations because it is **semantic**, meaning it allows you to work with higher-level music constructs such as chords and scales without needing to worry about the details.

Eventually, with enough support through adoption and tooling, `bach` could be used to engrave sheet music, drive audio synthesizers, synchronize lighting shows and much more.

The project is new and constsantly changing. It should be considered **experimental** and too immature for production use.

## Features

- Supports semantic music elements such as chords and scales
- Seamlessly synchronizes with audio or other data by minimizing the complexities around timing
- Calculates and provides all of the timing values that are essential or useful for playback
- Allows for alternative real-time representations of music or rhythms such as animation timelines
- Easy to read or write for musicians, programmers and computers

## Getting Started

Before moving on, please acknowledge that `bach` is a young experimental technology and is **not supported** by any tools you use.

Of course we are hopeful and optimistic that `bach` will grow to become a powerful tool for musicians and programmers alike.

In any case we are delighted that you've discovered `bach` and hope that you read on to become excited about its utility and potential.

> If you are a musician and would like to use `bach` to notate music then head to the [Guide](/guide) page.

> If you are a programmer and interested in using `bach` in your own project, you should also read the [Guide](/guide) section. From there we recommend reading the [Syntax](/syntax) and [Development](/development) pages.

> If you would like to learn more about the rationale for `bach` and the problems it attempts to solve then go to the [Background](/background) page.
