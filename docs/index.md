> :musical_score: Semantic music notation

## About

`bach` is a semantic music notation designed to be both human and computer friendly.

It's entirely text-based and allows you to easily notate music or any sort of rhythmic timeline you can imagine.

The project is new and constsantly changing. It should be considered experimental and too immature for production use.

Eventually, with enough support through adoption and tooling, `bach` could be used to create sheet music, algorithmically generate music, drive lighting animations and much more.

## Features

- Supports semantic music elements such as chords and scales
- Seamlessly synchronizes with audio or other data by minimizing the complexities around timing
- Calculates and provides all of the timing values that are essential or useful for playback
- Allows for alternative real-time representations of music or rhythms such as animation timelines
- Easy to read or write for musicians, programmers and computers

## Getting Started

If you are a musician and would like to use `bach` to notate music then head to the [Guide](/guide) page. But before heading there, be forewarned that `bach` is a young experimental technology and is **not supported** by any tools you use. Of course, we are hopeful and optimistic that this situation will change in the future.

If you are a programmer and interested in using `bach` in your own project, you should read the [Guide](/guide) section as well. From there we recommend reading the [Syntax](/syntax) and [Development](/development) pages.

If you would like to learn more about the rationale for `bach` and the problems it attempts to solve then go to the [Background](/background) page.
