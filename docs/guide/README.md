# Guide

## Introduction <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The purpose of this guide is to help people learn `bach` well enough to put it to practical use.

It is primarily written for musicians and assumes as little as possible about their technical expertise, although techical terms and details are sometimes required to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the notation.

Naturally, it also assumes that the reader has at least a basic understanding of music theory concepts such as tempo, meter, beats and measures.

As you read this guide you will encounter various examples of `bach`, sometimes partial and focused snippets and other times complete examples.

Whenever you are faced with new concepts and terms that feel overlooked or unclear, try to ignore them in that moment.

This guide is organized so that it will progressively fill in those details for you, in a way that (we feel) best gives you a hollistic understanding of `bach`.

You can find a collection of useful example tracks in the [Examples](#examples) section, but the majority of this guide focuses on a single example track (in the [Tracks](#tracks) section) to increase clarity.

> If you are looking for a more technical and low-level resource on `bach`, head to the [Syntax](/syntax) page instead.

> Because `bach` is a new technology, playback support, such as with audio, is currently only accessible to those with programming expertise (via [`gig`](/dev#gig)).
>
> If you're a musician with little to no programming experience, we still encourage you to continue reading this guide, but just be aware that you are currently unable to run any example tracks or tracks that you author.
>
> We are working on an open-source web editor that will allow you to author and play `bach` tracks, but in the meantime we hope you enjoy what you read!

## Components <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

As with learning anything new, the ideal place to start is the fundamentals. There are several different components of `bach` that you need to be knowledgeable in before you can start using it.

This guide provides as many details and examples as possible to help ensure that common questions, concerns and caveats are thoroughly addressed.

It's advised (but not required) that you read each component's section in the order it appears, only moving on to the next section after you've obtained a decent grasp on the current section's concepts.

With that said we can now dive into each of the components that make up `bach`, starting at the surface with "tracks".
