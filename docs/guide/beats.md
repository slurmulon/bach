### Beats

Beats represent an element paired with a duration in common time (more on this in the [Durations](#/durations) section).

So a beat not only says "here is something to play", but also "play it for this long".

Beats are defined using the `->` symbol, where the duration of the beat is written on the left, and the element to play is written on the right.

In this example we declare a beat that plays a "C minor" scale for a half note (or two beats) in common time.

```
1/2 -> Scale('C minor')
```

But a beat by itself isn't too useful. Rarely (if ever) does a song only contain a single note, chord or scale.
