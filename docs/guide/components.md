# Components

As with learning anything new, the ideal place to start is the fundamentals. There are several different components of `bach` that you need to be knowledgeable in before you can start using it.

This guide provides as many details and examples as possible to help ensure that common questions, concerns and caveats are thoroughly addressed.

It's advised (but not required) that you read each component's section in the order it appears, only moving on to the next section after you've obtained a decent grasp on the current section's concepts.

With that said we can now dive into each of the components that make up `bach`, starting at the surface with "tracks".
